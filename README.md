- Developed two Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) time-series models on historical bitcoin prices and Google
Trend data collected from API. Aggregated the models using linear regression to predict bitcoin price,
achieved Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than baseline model which used last dayâ€™s prediction.

- Implemented the predictive model into TensorTrade to learn a trading strategy using Reinforcement
Learning. Evaluated the trading strategy by backtesting, generated an increase in profit of 10,338USD.
